To load src outside of directory:

    mv main.c ../
    ./app
    coredumpctl debug
    directory ../

To get symbols outside of directory

    mv ./app.dbg ../
    ./app
    coredumpctl debug
    symbol-file ../app.dbg
    run

Though these work, you may want to always try to specify the source first
so you don't see:

    main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdde8) at main.c:7
    7	main.c: No such file or directory.
    (gdb) bt
    #0  main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdde8) at main.c:7
    (gdb) list
    2	in main.c

and instead see:

    (gdb) directory ../
    Source directories searched: /home/fred/Projects/tests/nulldref/..:$cdir:$cwd
    (gdb) bt
    #0  main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffdde8) at main.c:7
    (gdb) list
    2	#include <stdlib.h>
    3
    4	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    5	{
    6	    char *buf = NULL;
    7	    int value = *buf;
    8	    printf("test: %d\n", value);
    9	    return 0;
    10	}
    (gdb) run
